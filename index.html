    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <!--a floating picture of me being all cute n shit-->

    <!--a short biography 
    make it centered on the page vetically, as well as horzontally
    todo: include a before/after photo of me showing transition stuffs-->
    
    <p>So you want to know about me, do ya? *ahem* "Four score and seven years ago..." </p>
    <p>Just kidding! :P</p>
    <p>My name is Rhea (ray-ah) Mimi Carillo. You can call me Rhea (like the mythical Greek goddess). I am 30 years wise, a trans woman, and student at Code Fellows. My pronouns are SHE/HER.</p>
    <p>I am one of nine (9) siblings and the lot of us are first and second generation Filipino-American immigrants.</p>

    <!--education history-->
    <p>After graduating high school in Parkland, WA all the way back in 2010 I enrolled at Pierce College. I took classes at the Ft. Steilacoom campus intermittently 9 years and accumulated over 120 credits all over the board, but never satisfied the requirements for a degree.</p>
    <p>In 2019, I transferred to Green River College and took classes in Auburn, WA. That's where I learned a little something-something about coding and whet my pallet to the joys (and sorrows) of coding.

    </p>

    <!--overview of my job experience-->
    <p>Directly out of high school, I worked as a dishwasher and cashier at a fried chicken joint before making my way up to travelling knife salesperson. I wouldn't recommend that line of work to my worst enemy.</p>

    <p>I also served for 6 years in the Air Force (active duty). Hey, here's a picture if you're curious how that went: </p>

    <!--todo: find picture of me from the air force lmao-->
