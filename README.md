### Reflections and Comments

How did this go, overall?
Overall, I didn't have a problem doing the assignment, once I had it conceptualized. It did, however, take me a good long while to form a mental picture of what the assignment was, so I spent a couple hours reading carefully reading through the assignment instructions, as well as the the 201 github repo and carefully creating a plan of attack in the "Todoist" app. I broke down the project into bite-sized pieces that helped me comprehend what the requirements of the project are and in checklist format, as well as made the project seem less daunting and  made it so that I could keep a visual tracker of the progress I was making as I progressed through the feature tasks.
There was a loooot more ideas I wanted to implement, but it's nearly due, so them’s the breaks, as they say.

What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?
On observation I made is it felt to my eyes like the repetitiveness of typing out each if statement and the related prompts and conditionals were an exercise on building and further solidifying muscle memory.

How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
It took me a good 5.5 hours of work to finish this assignment. Including looking up how to use git, troubleshooting git, troubleshooting accidentally making branches and learning to merge branches, making the todoist checklist, as well as typing in code and writing flavor text.
I thought it could've been done in 1 hour for someone was just trying to make the bare requirements and I felt like I would have had it done in 2 hours, or 2.5 tops. I spent an extra three hours on learning to understand what all of the requirements of the lab were, essentially.
